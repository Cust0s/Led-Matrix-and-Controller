# Led-Matrix-and-Controller
Project based on 10x10 LED matrices controlled by a custom controller.

This project focusses on building a physical controller to run different animations on up to four LED matrices. Each LED matrix is using WS2812b eco individually addressable LEDs which are controlled by a teensy 3.5 inside of the controller.
